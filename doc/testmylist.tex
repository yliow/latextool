\section{Test mylist}

For comparison, this is enumerate:
\begin{enumerate}
\li Line 1. 
\li line 2.
\li line 3.
\end{enumerate}
After enumerate.

This is with paragraphing within items:
\begin{enumerate}
\li Line 1. 
This is a test. This is a test. This is a test. This is a test. 
This is a test. This is a test. This is a test. This is a test. 

Next paragraph.
\lipsum[1]

\li line 2.
\li line 3.
\end{enumerate}

A new paragraph after mylist.






\newpage

\verb!mylist! environment:
Vertical spacing between items is set to 0.
Also vertical and horizonal paragraph spacing in an item is set to 0. 

Testing mylist:
\begin{mylist}
\li line 1
\li line 2
\li line 3
\end{mylist}
After mylist.
Notice that there is no vertical spacing between items.
However there is still vertical spacing before and after the mylist.

This is with paragraphing within items:
\begin{mylist}
\li Line 1. 
This is a test. This is a test. This is a test. This is a test. 
This is a test. This is a test. This is a test. This is a test. 

Next paragraph.
\lipsum[1]

\li line 2.
\li line 3.
\end{mylist}

A new paragraph after above environment.
The next environment is in a new paragraph.

\begin{mylist}
\li line 1
\li line 2
\li line 3
\end{mylist}




\newpage

\verb!tightlist! environment: 
This is the same as mylist except that the vertical spacing
before and after the environment is removed.
This does not work quite right is the environment is in a paragraph of its
own -- there will be a little extra vertical spacing before the environment.

Testing tightlist:
\begin{tightlist}
\li line 1
\li line 2
\li line 3
\end{tightlist}
After environment.

This is with paragraphing within items:
\begin{tightlist}
\li Line 1. 
This is a test. This is a test. This is a test. This is a test. 
This is a test. This is a test. This is a test. This is a test. 

Next paragraph.
\lipsum[1]

\li line 2.
\li line 3.
\end{tightlist}

A new paragraph after above environment.
The next environment is in a new paragraph.

\begin{tightlist}
\li line 1
\li line 2
\li line 3
\end{tightlist}
